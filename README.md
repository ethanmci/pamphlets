# Pamphlets <small>(name subject to change)</small>

## About this project
Pamphlets is a notes taking application built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

## Development 

To build a hot-swappable development version of the application use:
```
npm run tauri dev
```

If instead you would rather build only the SvelteKit front-end, it can built using:
```
npm run dev
```
This will by default serve the front-end at `http://localhost:1420/`
